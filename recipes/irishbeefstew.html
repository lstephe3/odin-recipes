        <h3>How to cook the perfect Irish Beef Stew</h3>

        <p class="recipep">Winter pleasures don’t get much simpler than a steaming pot of Irish stew: cheap, easy and gloriously warming, they’re the culinary equivalent of a big woolly scarf. Yet, with so many much-loved traditional dishes, the recipe itself is a bubbling cauldron of controversy: hardline purists maintain that it should contain nothing but meat, onions, potatoes and water, while others proffer treasured family recipes thickened with pearl barley, or sweetened with root vegetables.</p>

        <p class="recipep">This recipe is a modern take that forgoes the traditional lamb or mutton (not such a cheap option these days), instead opting for the more affordable beef.</p>

            <li>1½kg/3lb 5oz stewing beef, cut into cubes</li>
